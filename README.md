# Overview


I have always been interested in low level coding and understand memory management and macros. This project helped me have a greater grasp on what code is really telling the computer

I followed a tutorial (listed below) that built a basic OS. Currently, the OS can display data to the QEMU virtual machine. It also has a print and println macro, and an add and subtract macro that I built to get a better grasp on macros.

I developed this software primarily to understand how a software works, I don't see it going much further than a simple exercise in understanding low level programming

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

* I used IntelliJ as my IDE
* I used Rust for coding
* I built some basic libraries for the OS
* QEMU virtual machine

# Useful Websites

* [Short explanation of Macros](https://blog.logrocket.com/macros-in-rust-a-tutorial-with-examples/#:~:text=Rust%20has%20two%20types%20of,that%20replaces%20the%20macro%20invocation )
* [Tutorial](https://os.phil-opp.com/)

# Future Work

* I need to finish the testing so that they work from a library.
* I want to add user input.
* I need to repair my mistakes from transferring data from the main to the library (A lot of the lib.rs code is directly from the tutorial)
